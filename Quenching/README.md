This directory creates the figures plotted from quenched structures. It contains two notebooks that process data from relaxed (quenched) structures from the MD:

- `Structural Characterisation.ipynb`: which plots the RDFs in Fig 5 and Fig S4a from structures relaxed from full MD
- `Structural Characterisation Static.ipynb`: which plots the RDFs in S4b from structures relaxed from MD with static fluorine.

The relaxed structures are drawn from the directiories:
- `Structures`: contains quenched structures from the real MD.
- `Static_structures`: contains quenched structures from the static fluorine MD.

These structures are provided in the full version of this dataset, which is available on the University of Bath Research Data Archive, and contains:

- `INCAR`
- `vasprun.xml`
- `POSCAR` (starting structure drawn from MD)
- `CONTCAR` (relaxed structure)
