This directory creates the figures plotted from quenched structures it containts two notebooks which process data from relaxed (quenched) structures from the MD:
- Structural Characterisation which plots the RDFs in Fig 5 and Fig S4a from structures relaxed from full MD
- Structural Characterisation  which plots the RDFs in S4b from structures relaxed from MD with static fluorine.
The relaxed structures are drawn from the directiories:
- Structures: contains quenched structures from the real MD.
- Static_structures: containes quenched structures from the static fluorine MD.
These structures are availible in the version present on the bath research archive and contain:
- INCAR
- vasprun.xml
- POSCAR (starting structure drawn from MD)
- CONTCAR (relaxed structure)
