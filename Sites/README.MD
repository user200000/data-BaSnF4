This subdirectory handles site and density based analysis it contains three jupyter notebooks:
Density Calculation.ipynb - This calculates the three dimensional density using revelsMD.
BaSnF4_F_desnity.ipynb - This creates Figure 6 from the cube file created in Density Calculation.ipynb
Site_based_analyis - This book is larger than the other theoretical contributions to the data set and handles all site based anaylysis. It plots Figs. 7, 9 and 12 and generates the related occupancy tables presented in the SI.
