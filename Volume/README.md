This subdirectory handles site- and density-based analysis. It contains three Jupyter notebooks:

`Volume Calculation.ipynb`: This calculates optimal volume at 600&nbsp;K from short trajectories of systems with different sizes.

The full version of this dataset, available from the University of Bath Research Data Archive, contains a set of subdirectiories labeled `SQS1` to `SQS11`. Each of these directories contains four run files labelled `r1` to `r4`. These runs follow each other numerically. Each directory contains the following files:

- `OUTCAR`
- `POSCAR` (starting structure)
- `CONTCAR` (final structure)
- `vasprun.xml`
- `INCAR`
